          <h5>Developer & <span>Designer</span></h5>
          <p style="color: black">
            Hi, I'm <strong>Dharamveer Kumar</strong>, a passionate and
            versatile individual currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in
            Computer Science and Engineering at Bakhtiyarpur College of
            Engineering. Born and raised in Patna, Bihar, I have always been
            driven by curiosity and innovation. My academic journey began with
            stellar performances, achieving 86.3% in matriculation from Shiksha
            Niketan School, Hajipur, and 82% in intermediate studies at Holy
            Kids International School, Chhapra.
          </p>
          <p style="color: black">
            Over the years, I have cultivated a wide range of skills and
            experiences. As the <strong>Head Coordinator</strong> for the
            Designing and Branding Club and the Photography Club, I have
            demonstrated strong leadership and organizational abilities. My role
            as a coordinator in the Training and Placement Cell has further
            enhanced my team management and multitasking capabilities.
          </p>
          <p style="color: black">
            Professionally, I have dived deep into the fields of web development
            and machine learning. I have successfully completed internships in
            AI, ML, and Salesforce, which have given me hands-on experience and
            problem-solving expertise. Additionally, I have managed various
            social media platforms, crafted stunning visuals through graphic
            designing, and honed my skills in photography and cinematography.
          </p>
          <p style="color: black">
            My technical toolkit includes proficiency in C, Python, Java, and
            MERN stack development. Alongside these technical skills, I excel in
            project management, social media strategies, and branding. My
            passion lies in leveraging technology and creativity to solve
            real-world problems and create impactful solutions.
          </p>
          <p style="color: black">
            With a strong foundation in both academics and extracurricular
            activities, I am ready to take on challenges, innovate, and make a
            meaningful impact in the tech and creative world.
